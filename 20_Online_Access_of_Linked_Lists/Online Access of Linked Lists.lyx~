\begin_layout Title
Online Access of Linked Lists
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Online Access of Linked Lists (Sleator and Tarjan 1985)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Preliminaries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One important application of online algorithms is in self-adjusting data
 structures like splay trees and cache.
 Given a linked list of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 items, we receive a sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(1),\dots,\sigma(m)$
\end_inset

 of accesses to items with 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 a priori unknown.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(t)$
\end_inset

 is in position 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in the linked list, we pay 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 for finding it because we must linear search to it.
 Subsequently, we can move 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 forward in the list for free if we wish, and we can also swap any two adjacent
 elements (other than 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) at a cost of one per swap.
 Our goal is to approximately minimize total cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some reasonable heuristics include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
FC (frequency count): Keep the elements sorted by the number of accesses
 so far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Static ordering: A possibly optimal static ordering with hindsight allowed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
MTF (move to front): When 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is accessed, move it all the way to the front.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
TRANS (transposition): Move 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 one element forward when accessed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Spectrum between MTF and TRANS (move 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 two elements forward, move 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 half the distance to the front, etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of these heuristics, only one has nice guarantees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Initial Bounds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For all algorithms on a sequence length 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, we know that their cost must be 
\begin_inset Formula $\leq kn$
\end_inset

 – the upper bound occurs when the last element in the linked list appears
 in every request.
 Furthermore we know that the cost of OPT is 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq k$
\end_inset

, because it could possibly request the first element every time.
 So the upper bound on the competitive ratio is 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, but we really want the algorithm to be constant competitive.
 We'll study several heuristics to see that they are 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{n}{2}$
\end_inset

 competitive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For FC, we could receive an input which accesses the first element 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 times, the second 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

, and so on, accessing the last element 
\begin_inset Formula $t-(n-1)$
\end_inset

 times.
 Then, the cost is 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq\frac{n}{2}*n*(t-(n-1))\approx\frac{n^{2}t-n^{3}}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, OPT would have cost 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{2}-tn$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the competitive ratio would be:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}\frac{n^{2}t-n^{3}}{2(n^{2}+tn)}=\frac{n}{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Static is exactly the same.
 For TRANS, we could receive an input which alternates accessing element
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and element 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

.
 They would just infinitely switch places, so there would be a cost 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 for each iteration, while OPT would have a cost of 1 per iteration.
 Thus, we can have arbitrarily long sequences with ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta(n)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By process of elimination, MTF must be the heuristic to give good guarantees.
 We'll prove that it is 2-competitive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
MTF Competitive Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
MTF is 2-competitive for any sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall\sigma,c_{MTF}(\sigma)\leq2*c_{OPT}(\sigma)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
This proof would be easy if we could show that in each step 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{MTF}(i)\leq2*c_{OPT}(i)$
\end_inset

.
 However, this cannot work because it is possible for OPT to invest cost
 in early steps to make later items cheaper by moving certain items around.
 Thus, we at least will need amortized analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Define a 
\series bold
potential function
\series default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi(i)$
\end_inset

 that measures how similar the MTF list and OPT list are at any step 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi(i)=0$
\end_inset

 means that the lists are identical.
 Then, let 
\begin_inset Formula $c'_{MTF}(i)=c_{MTF}(i)+\Phi(i+1)-\Phi(i)$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, we get bonus points for making the MTF list more similar
 to the OPT list, and extra costs for making them different.
